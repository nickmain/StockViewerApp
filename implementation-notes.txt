Observations:

 * API rate limit is 5 calls per minute. This is very restrictive.
 * Only end-of-day data is available.
 
I had to time-box this exercise to a single day, so the "Add Stock" search screen is rushed and still prone to hitting the rate limit.

The user's selected stocks are saved to UserDefaults and restored upon launch. In order to provide a better first-launch experience (and since the Add Stock function is flakey) there are 3 initial stocks selected.

The stock detail page is an MVP and needs more work.
